The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) introduces new rules for organizations that offer goods and services to people in the European Union (EU), or that collect and analyze data for EU residents no matter where you or your enterprise are located. Additional details can be found at [GDPR][GDPRhomeTopic].

This document summarizes a prioritized action plan to meet the requirements of the GDPR. Learn more about how to use this action plan at: [Chart your Microsoft 365 compliance path and information protection strategy.][ChartCompliance]

## Accountability Readiness Checklists ##

Accountability readiness checklists are provided to conveniently access information you may need to support the GDPR using Microsoft products and services. A general outline is given below.

The checklist lists potential obligations you may have under the GDPR, and points you to information that you can use to support your organizations’ compliance. There is a specific guide for four Microsoft product and services families: Office 365, Dynamics, Azure, and Microsoft Services. For details regarding your Microsoft implementation follow the link in [Accountability readiness checklists for the GDPR][accReadiness]. You can manage the items in this checklist with [Compliance Manager][complMgr] by referencing the Control ID and Control Title under Customer Managed Controls in the GDPR tile.
